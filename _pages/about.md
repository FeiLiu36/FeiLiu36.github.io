Hello, I am Fei Liu, a PhD student supervised by [Prof. Qingfu Zhang](http://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/qingfu.zhang.htm), Department of Computer Science, [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/). 

Before joining CityU, I completed my master's and bachelor's degrees at Northwestern Polytechnical University.

I am currently interested in automatic algorithm design, artificial intelligence, optimization algorithm and their applications on real-world problems.
