Hello, I am Fei Liu, a Postdoc researcher in [Prof. Qingfu Zhang's Group](http://optima.cs.cityu.edu.hk/), Department of Computer Science, [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/). 

I completed my PhD degree at CityU supervised by [Prof. Qingfu Zhang](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~qzhan7/index.html), my master's and bachelor's degrees at Northwestern Polytechnical University supervised by [Prof. Zhonghua Han](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/zhonghuahan.html).

I am currently interested in automatic algorithm design, artificial intelligence, optimization algorithm and their applications on real-world problems.
